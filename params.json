{"name":"Jake Williams","tagline":"ADVENTURE TO THE VOLCANO OF FROSTFIRE","body":"## The Loud Phone Call \r\n\r\nOne fine morning, when I was sleeping, the phone rang as loud as a thousand **howling** wolves. I woke up and got it. The voice on the other side said,”Look in the mailbox.” The other person hung up and then I went to the mailbox and opened it. There was a letter and two plane tickets to the Wolfia islands. On the bottom of the letter, it said, ‘From your cousin, Ken.’ Ken is my smart cousin who likes to > adventure.\r\n\r\nOops, I forgot to introduce myself! My name is _Jacob Williams_, but you can call me Jake. I live in the city of Chicadog. I’m a white wolf and Ken’s a gray wolf. I write books about my adventures.  The next day, when I reached Wolfia, I met Ken over there. He took me to the hotel we were going to live in and started telling me that he was here for a few days now and about all the fun he had. I was also looking forward to having some fun when Ken started talking about something serious.\r\n\r\nHe said there was a thief around and all the citizens of Wolfia were being robbed. He said we could be able to catch this thief. Then, later at night, I woke up to take some water and saw two huge glowing eyes! I ran out and rang the alarm. You could guess what happened next. The whole hotel was in chaos. Everyone was running around thinking there was a fire. But someone found out there was no fire a he said I was the one who rang the alarm, which was true. I got many lectures that night and the next day, Ken came to my room and asked me what happened.\r\n\r\nI told him I saw two yellow glowing eyes. He said if I had simply just told the other people, I wouldn’t have gotten put in the mental ward of the hotel. He giggled and then told me that the other problem was that the people were being troubled by this creature.\r\n\r\nI wondered what this creature might be. Probably a racoon? A cat? A frog? What if it was a huge bird? Nobody knew, and it was my job to find out. At night, when I was reading a book, I got hit on the head.\r\n When I woke up, I was in a cave. I looked around and saw Ken lying there. I went near him and shook him, but it turns out he had passed out. I sat there till he came to. Then we roamed around the cave. It was huge. It was like three igloos made of stone. They all had walls and only one opening was there in each wall. We went to the other ‘igloos’. One was empty and the other one had 4 wolves and 2 cute little pups. They said they had been hit on the head and when they woke up, they were here.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t know anything else and had come just a day ago. Then I suggested we could dig out of the snow in the bottom floor. Wait a minute, if it was sunny on the island, how come there’s snow here? As I had told you Ken is smart. He did a few calculations and said we could be near the Volcano of Frost Fire.\r\n\r\nI asked him what Frost Fire is and he said it’s fire that’s blue and isn’t hot but is cold.\r\n\r\n## Where Are We?\r\n\r\nKen said that we can’t dig as this is an island. We started wondering what to do . Ken suggested we could climb our way to the top which was open . I said wolves cant climb , then I said we could push the rocks on the walls of the cave. Ken said it was a good idea , we all started pushing the rocks . Only in one spot, the rocks moved. All of us ,who were stuck in the cave started pushing in that one spot , when we finally got the stone out there was one more stone ,this kept on happening till we cleared seven huge boulders .\r\n\r\nFinally the last layer of thick snow then remained, and then we finally got out. We had spent three hours in this process. The other four wolves and their pups thanked us for getting them out; we said welcome and went on our way.\r\n\r\nWe saw the volcano ,but we didn’t see the frost fire.\r\nWe went up the volcano and saw the frost fire inside. Then all of a sudden, someone pushed us in! But it turns out that frost fire was just some phony experiment. It was just some blue glowing cold water.\r\nInside, there was a lab with four rooms. One room had potions in it, they were black potions, white potions, colourful ones and a few pills.\r\n\r\nThe other had a few experiments. The last two rooms had scientists working in them. Ken and I saw one scientist going in the potion room, bringing three bottles, one with no potion and the other two with orange potion and red potion respectively. Then she mixed both of them and made the blue glowing water.\r\nThen she put it in a pipe from where it came on the volcano top and also the lab only had a small hole from where we fell in so none of the glowing water had fallen with us.\r\nOne of the scientists saw Ken and me and came to us. He asked us about how we came in this top secret area.\r\n\r\nI said we came on the top of the volcano and someone pushed us down here. The scientist said now that we know about this secret area, we should not tell anyone.\r\nWe agreed and he gave us a tour around the whole place. It wasn’t as small as we thought. In fact it was a vast place. The lab had many scientists experimenting with different things. There was one experiment I kept in mind. I think it’s quite easy but I had never heard of it.\r\n\r\nThe formula was:-\r\nIce/Snow + Salt = Water/Melted Ice.\r\nIt could come in handy. Then when the tour was over, the scientist said if we had taken anything in mind.\r\nI told him that the formula, Ken told one more:-\r\nStrawberry Juice + Mango Juice = Glowing blue water.\r\n\r\nI started wondering how tow juices could create glowing water. Then I got to know, it was real lava mixed by a weird orange coconut kind of fruit.\r\n\r\n## Where is the real Volcano?\r\n\r\nI started wondering where it was. I asked the scientist where the real volcano was, if this was just a replica. He said he didn’t know. Ken said in my ears “If he doesn’t know, how is this volcano replica there?, I wonder who knows about the original volcano”\r\n\r\nThat was true, so we decided to ask all the scientists there. It was quite annoying asking hundreds of people about some volcano and listening to their extended talks.\r\n\r\nFinally one of the scientists answered in a delightful “Yes” I was awfully happy! She said it was on the faraway island, she also said it was fifty miles off the coast; I had no idea how we were going to travel such a long distance.\r\n\r\nKen said “ We going by the boat “ , Then I said “ Mr dear brother , please speak proper English “ Ken said “ O-okay “ as he got vent scared , He was also shivering badly.\r\n\r\nI was already frustrated so I shouted at him again “Stop, whining!, He stopped whining and sat very alert. I could tell that my brother was ashamed that he got scared of me.\r\n\r\nShe gave us a map showing where the other island was.\r\n\r\nI definitely wouldn’t want to go to the Catskill islands I hate cars .But we had to go as that is the closest from Wolfia . I told Jen we could go to Mirstikami instead.\r\nHe agreed and booked a boat for us, Surprisingly when I saw our ticket , it was written :-\r\n\r\nGoing to : - Mirstikami cluster\r\nGondoliers’/Boaters name : MR Spike Biter\r\nPassengers “ Three\r\n\r\nI asked Ken who the third person was, He said the professor who has given a tour. We hadn’t got his name. When he came I asked him.\r\nHis name was Prof Innocley Smartfur. Ken whispered, “What a weird name “. I nodded. He gave an evil smirk. Later that day, on the Mirtani Island of the Mirstikami cluster, when we were resting, we heard a scream, it was from a bat.\r\nAll of a sudden, millions of bat swarmed around and it was black everywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
